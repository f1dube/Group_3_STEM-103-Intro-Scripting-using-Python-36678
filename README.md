# Adventure Game ReadMe

## Project Overview
This repository contains an interactive text-based adventure game that is both entertaining and educational. The game combines storytelling with academic guidance, allowing users to explore various areas of interest and receive personalized course recommendations.

## Features

### Interactive Character Selection
Users can choose from a variety of characters, each with a unique description, to accompany them on their journey.

### Personalized Interests
Players select an area of academic interest from four options:
- Computing and IT
- Science
- Engineering
- Health Sciences

### Step-by-Step Guidance
Inspired by the EvCC Getting Started page, the game provides step-by-step instructions. Players can navigate through the instructions by interacting with the program (e.g., by pressing "Enter").

### Course Recommendations
Based on the chosen area of interest, the game suggests tailored courses:
- **Computing and IT:** STEM 101, STEM 103, and an English course.
- **Science:** STEM 101, STEM 102, and a Math course.
- **Engineering:** STEM 101, ENGR 111, and a Math course.
- **Health Sciences:** STEM 101, STEM 102, and an English course.

### Programming Elements
The game implements at least:
- Five variables with descriptive camelCase naming.
- Five print statements.
- Three input statements.
- Three if conditions.

### Adventure Story Theme
The game incorporates creative storytelling elements, such as fantasy, space, or robots, to engage users in their academic exploration.

## Research Findings
Our project integrates findings on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data security. Key insights include:

### Data Security in AI Systems
- Securing user data in AI-based academic tools is essential for protecting privacy and building trust. Techniques include encryption and anonymization.
- The importance of transparency and ethical considerations in handling student data is highlighted in research on secure educational platforms.
